            <p>You lived before you met me?! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Bite my shiny metal ass. Guess again. Hello Morbo, how's the family?</p>
            <p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! <strong> What are their names?</strong> <em> Who are those horrible orange men?</em> Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
            <p>Shut up and get to the point! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Meh. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Soothe us with sweet lies.</li>
                <li>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</li>
                <li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
            <p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Soon enough. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
            <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… It's a T. It goes "tuh".</p>
